## What is Mathlified?

Mathlified is a monorepo containing various packages
exploring the creation of modern mathematical content.

We will cover the intersection between mathematics, mathematics education,
mathematical typesetting, and web and mobile development.

## Project status

We are in very early alpha, and will slowly build things out from here.

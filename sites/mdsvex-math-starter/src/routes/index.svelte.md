# Welcome to mdsvex math SvelteKit starter

## Static math

With this skeleton setup we can render math
with markup almost exactly like $LaTeX$.

## Demo

The quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ has roots

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

## Source code (in mdsvex markdown)

```latex
The quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ has roots

$$
x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$
```
